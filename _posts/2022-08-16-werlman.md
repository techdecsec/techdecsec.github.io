Selfish mining is a known security vulnerability in blockchain protocols. In our latest paper, we show reward variability leads to increased vulnerability to selfish mining in Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies. To do so, we use deep reinforcement learning to analyze the effect of whale transactions, occasional large rewards, on selfish mining. Since reward variability in Bitcoin will increase in the future, its security will degrade.
